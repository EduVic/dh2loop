Veining is dominated by an intense quartz-epidote vein series in the lowest 50cm of the unit - this is probably the vein that carried much of the silica alteration. Biotite and chlorite are disprersed throughout the matrix, and are useful for defining foliation. Sulphides are not generally disseminated, but are common in and around veins. Pyrite is most common, the remaider spread near equally between chalcopyrite and bornite. Possible very minor arsenopyrite disseminated in a narrow zon uphole of the major veining. A series of minor parallel faults run through a quartz vein at approximately 196.5m, throw tends to be minor, no more than cm scale."""
